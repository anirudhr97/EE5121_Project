## Real World Datasets
### Spectra Problem
The spectra dataset can be found as 'spectra.mat' in this repository.

-- If you do not have the spectra dataset on your MATLAB version, use the 'spectra.mat' file given in this repository. Use the following command 
to import the dataset into your MATLAB workspace:
$ spectra = importdata('spectra.mat')

-- Use the following command to get an idea on what the dataset is about:
$ spectra.Description

Once this dataset has been imported into your MATLAB workspace, the plots shown in the slides can be obtained by running 'test_random_data'.
The plots generated will be saved as .png files in the Plots/ subdirectory.

### Random Matrix Problem
We test the working of the algorithms on randomly generated matrices(The random matrices are generated from the normal distribution).

The plots shown in the slides can be obtained by running 'test_spectra_data'. The plots generated will be saved as .png files in the Plots/ subdirectory.
